In this project, I have worked on the Netflix dataset. Here, for data analysis, the very first step is to transform the data or to make the dataset clean to perform operations.
All duplicates value has been removed from the dataset and then null/nan values have been found.
This project answers several questions which might be associated with the dataset.
we are required to have complete knowledge and understanding of the database and only we can make any conclusion from it.
